# API Testing Automation Repository

This repository is a collection of experiments with various free-to-use websites created to help people practice and have fun with API testing automation. 
The primary goal is to play around with different types of public APIs and automate the testing process using **Pytest** and **Python** 

- **Pytest** for writing and executing automated test scripts
- **Requests lib** for sending HTTP requests
