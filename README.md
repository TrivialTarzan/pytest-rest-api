# API Testing Automation Repository

This repository is a collection of experiments with various free-to-use websites created to help people master API testing automation. The goal is to explore different types of public APIs and automate the testing process using tools like **Postman**, **Pytest**, and other relevant frameworks.

## Purpose

- To practice and improve skills in API testing automation.
- To experiment with different testing methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- To understand common API response structures and error handling.

## Tools Used

- **Postman**: For testing APIs and automating requests.
- **Pytest**: For writing and executing automated test scripts.
- **Requests Library**: For sending HTTP requests in Python.

## Structure

- **/tests**: Contains automated test cases for different APIs.
- **/docs**: Documentation for various API endpoints and their expected behavior.
- **/scripts**: Python scripts for API testing automation.
